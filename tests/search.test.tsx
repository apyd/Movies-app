// Write at least one test for your interactive react components.
// For example, in your test render the search panel and verify that it matches the snapshot.
// Then fire input events to simulate typing into the search input and then fire a click event on the "Search" button.
// Verify that proper callbacks passed to component in props are called or verify that expected effects are produced.
